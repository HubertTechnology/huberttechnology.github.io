<h1 style="text-align:center">Decision Control Statements</h1>
<h2><u>4.1 if statement</u></h2>
<p>In Python, the if statement is used to perform different actions based on whether a certain condition is true or false. It allows you to control the flow of 
your program by executing certain blocks of code only if certain conditions are met.</p>
<h4><u>Different forms of implementation of if-statement are:</u></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Basic if-statement:</li>
	<li>if-else statement</li>
	<li>if-elif-else statement</li>
	<li>Nested if statement</li>
	<li>One-liner if-statement (also called ternary operator):</li>
</ul>
<h4><u>if statement</u></h4>
<p> This is used to executed the statements only if the condition is <b>true.</b></p>
<h4><u>Syntax</u></h4>
<pre>
<table style="border:2px solid green"><tr><td>
  if condition:
  #code to be executed if the condition is true
	
</tr></td></table></pre>
<h4><u>Example</u></h4>
<pre>
x = 5
if<b style="color:magenta"> x </b>> 0:
  print("x is positive")

<i>In this example, the if statement checks if the value of the variable x is greater than 0. If it is, the code inside the if block, 
print("x is positive"), is executed.</i>
</pre>

<h2><u>4.2 if-else statement</u></h2>
n if-else statement in Python is used to specify what code should be executed when a certain condition is true, and what code should be 
executed when the condition is false. The basic syntax for an if-else statement is:
<h4><u>Synstax:</u></h4>
<pre>
if condition:
    # code to be executed if the condition is true
else:
    # code to be executed if the condition is false

</pre>
<p> if condition is true then block 1 statement will be executed and if condition is false block 2 statement will execute.</p>
<h4><u>Example</u></h4>
<pre>
x = 5
if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
else:
    print("x is not positive")

</pre>
<h4><u>Output:</u></h4>
<pre>
	x is positive
</pre>
<h2><u>4.3 if-elif-else statement</u></h2>
<p>An if-elif-else statement in Python is used to check multiple conditions and execute different code blocks based on which condition is true. The basic syntax for an if-elif-else statement is:</p>
<h4><u>Syntax:</u></h4>
<pre>
if condition1:
    # code to be executed if condition1 is true
elif condition2:
    # code to be executed if condition2 is true
...
elif conditionN:
    # code to be executed if conditionN is true
else:
    # code to be executed if all conditions are false

</pre>

<h4><u>Example:</u></h4>
<pre>
x = -5
if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
elif x == 0:
    print("x is zero")
else:
    print("x is negative")

</pre>
<h4><u>Output:</u></h4>
<pre>
	x is negative
</pre>
<h2><u>4.4 Nested if statement</u></h2>
<p>A nested if statement in Python is an if statement that is used inside another if statement. The basic syntax for a nested if statement is:</p>
<h4><usyntax</u></h4>
<h4><u>Synstax:</u></h4>
<pre>
if condition1:
    # code to be executed if condition1 is true
    if condition2:
    # code to be executed if condition2 is true
    else:
    # code to be executed if condition2 is false
else:
    # code to be executed if condition1 is false

</pre>
<h4><u>Example:</u></h4>
<pre>
x = 10
y = 20
if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
    if y > 0:
        print("y is positive")
    else:
        print("y is not positive")
else:
    print("x is not positive")

</pre>
<h4><u>Output:</u></h4>
<pre>
	x is positive
	y is positive

In this example, the outer if statement checks if the value of the variable x is greater than 0. If it is true, the code inside the first if block will 
be executed, which is print("x is positive"). Then, the inner if statement checks if the value of the variable y is greater than 0. If it is true, the code 
inside the second if block will be executed, which is print("y is positive"). If y is not greater than 0, the code inside the else block, 
print("y is not positive"), is executed. If x is not greater than 0, the code inside the outer else block, print("x is not positive"), is executed.</i>
</pre>

<h2><u>4.5 A one-liner if statement</u></h2>
<p>A one-liner if statement in Python is a way to write an if statement on a single line of code, it's also known as a ternary operator. 
The basic syntax for a one-liner if statement is:</p>
<h4><u>Syntax:</u></h4>
<pre>
value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
</pre>
<h4><u>Example:</u></h4>
<pre>
x = -5
print("x is positive") if x > 0 else print("x is not positive")

In this case, the statement will directly print the corresponding message without the need of a variable.
It's worth noting that one-liner if statements are useful when you need to perform a simple action based on a condition, 
and you want to keep your code short and easy to read. However, it's recommended to use the standard if-else statement when the code block
is more complex or when you need to perform multiple actions based on the condition.
It's also important to note that one-liner if statement can be more difficult to understand, especially when the condition and the action to be executed are more complex.
