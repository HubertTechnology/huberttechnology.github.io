<h2><u>Algorithm</u></h2>
<p>A sequential solution of any program that written in human language, called algorithm. Algorithm is first step of the solution process, after the analysis of problem, programmer writes
 the algorithm of that problem. It can be understood by taking an example of cooking a new recipe. To cook a new recipe, one reads the instructions and steps and
 execute them one by one, in the given sequence. The result thus obtained is the new dish cooked perfectly. Similarly, algorithms help to do a task in programming
 to get the expected output. The Algorithm designed are language-independent, i.e. they are just plain instructions that can be implemented in any language, and yet
 the output will be the same, as expected.

<p><b><u>Characteristics of Algorithm:</b></u></p>
<li><b>  Clear and Unambiguous:</b> Algorithm should be clear and unambiguous. Each of its steps should be clear in all aspects and must lead to only one meaning.</li>
 <li><b>  Well-Defined Inputs:</b>  If an algorithm says to take inputs, it should be well-defined inputs.</li>
<li><b>   Well-Defined Outputs:</b>  The algorithm must clearly define what output will be yielded and it should be well-defined as well.</li>
<li><b>   Finite-ness:</b>  The algorithm must be finite, i.e. it should not end up in an infinite loops or similar.</li>
<li><b>   Feasible:</b>  The algorithm must be simple, generic and practical, such that it can be executed upon with the available resources. It must not contain some future technology, or anything.
<li><b>   Language Independent:</b> The Algorithm designed must be language-independent, i.e. it must be just plain instructions that can be implemented in any language, and yet the output will be same, as expected.</li>
</p>



<p><b><u>Advantages of Algorithms:</u></b></p>
<li> It is easy to understand.
<li> Algorithm is a step-wise representation of a solution to a given problem.
<li> In Algorithm the problem is broken down into smaller pieces or steps hence, it is easier for the programmer to convert it into an actual program.

<p><b><u>Disadvantages of Algorithms:</u></b></p>
<li> Writing an algorithm takes a long time so it is time-consuming.
<li> Branching and looping statements are difficult to show in Algorithms.
</li>


<p><b>Example of Algorithm?</b></p>
Algorithm for add two numbers entered by the user. 
<li> Step 1: Start </li>
<li> Step 2: Declare 3 variables num1, num2 and sum. </li>
<li> Step 3: Read values num1 and num2. </li>
<li> Step 4: Add num1 and num2 and assign the result to sum. sum ← num1+num2 </li>
<li> Step 5: Print sum </li>
<li> Step 6: Stop
</li>

<p><b><u>Flowchart</u></b></p>
Flowchart Flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm. Programmers often use it as a program-planning tool to solve a problem.
It makes use of symbols which are connected among them to indicate the flow of information and processing.The process of drawing a flowchart for an algorithm is known as “flowcharting”.

<h3>
Advantages of Flowchart:</h3>
<li>  Flowcharts are better way of communicating the logic of system.</li>
<li>  Flowcharts act as a guide for blueprint during program designed.</li>
<li>  Flowcharts helps in debugging process.</li>
<li>  With the help of flowcharts programs can be easily analyzed.</li>
<li>  It provides better documentation.</li>
<li>  Flowcharts serve as a good proper documentation.</li>


<h3>
Disadvantages of Flowchart:</h3>
<li> It is difficult to draw flowchart for large and complex programs.</li>
<li> In this there is no standard to determine the amount of detail.</li>
<li> Difficult to reproduce the flowcharts.</li>
<li> It is very difficult to modify the Flowchart.</li>
