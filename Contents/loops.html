<h1 style="text-align:center"><u>Loop</u></h1>
<p>In Python, loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. 
There are several types of loops in Python, each with its own use case.</p>
<h2><u>5.1 for Loop</u></h2>
<p>for loops: for loops are used to iterate over a sequence of elements, such as a list, tuple, or string. The basic syntax of a for loop is:
</p>
<h4><u>Syntax of Loop:</u></h4>
<pre><table style="border: 2px solid green"><tr><td>
    for variable in sequence:
    # code to be executed


</td></tr></table></pre>
<h4><u>Example:</u></h4>
<pre><table style="border: 2px solid green"><tr><td>
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    print(num)

</td></tr></table></pre>
<h4><u>Output:</u></h4>
<table style="border: 2px solid green"><tr><td>
	1
	2
	3
	4
	5         	
</td></tr></table>

<h4><u>Explanation:</u></h4>
<p>In this example, the for loop iterates over the list numbers and assigns each element to the variable num in each iteration. 
The code inside the loop, print(num), is executed for each element in the list, resulting in the numbers 1 through 5 being printed to the console.</p>

<h2><u>5.2 while Loop</u></h2>
<p>while loops: while loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. The basic syntax of a while loop is:</p>
<h4><u>Syntax:</u></h4>
<pre><table style="border: 2px solid green"><tr><td>
    while condition:
    # code to be executed

</td></tr></table></pre>
<h4><u>Example:</u></h4>
<pre><table style="border: 2px solid green"><tr><td>
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1

</table></tr></td></pre>
<h4><u>Output</u></h4>
<pre><table style="border:2px solid green"><tr><td>
 0
 1
 2
 3
 4
</table></tr></td></pre>

<h2><u>5.3 Nested Loops</u></h2>
<p>Python programming language allows to use one loop inside another loop. Following section shows few examples to illustrate the concept. </p>
<h4><u>Syntax:</u></h4>
<pre><table style="border: 2px solid green"><tr><td>
for iterator_var in sequence:
   for iterator_var in sequence:
       statements(s)
   statements(s)
</td></tr></table></pre>
<p>The syntax for a nested while loop statement in the Python programming language is as follows:</p> 

<h4><u>Syntax:</u></h4>
<pre>
while expression:
   while expression: 
       statement(s)
   statement(s)
</pre>
<h1 style="text-align:center"><u>Loop Control Statement</u></h1>
Loop control statements in Python are used to control the flow of the loop and affect how the loop iterates. 
There are several types of loop control statements in Python, including:
<h2>Break Statement</h2>
<p>break: The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, before the loop's condition is met. 
When a break statement is encountered, the loop is immediately terminated and the program continues with the next statement after the loop.
</p>



<h4><u>Example:</u></h4>
<pre><table style="border:2px solid green"> <tr><td>
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    if num == 3:
        break
    print(num)

</table></tr></td></pre>
<h4><u>Output</u></h4>
<pre><table style="border:2px solid green"><tr><td>
 1
 2
</table></tr></td></pre>
In this example, the for loop iterates over the list numbers, and the code inside the loop, print(num), is executed for each element. 
However, when the if statement evaluates to true and num == 3, the break statement is executed, the loop is immediately terminated and the 
program continues with the next statement after the loop.

<h2>Continue Statement</h2>
<p>continue: The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration. 
When a continue statement is encountered, the current iteration is skipped and the program continues with the next iteration of the loop.</p>
<h4><u>Example</u></h4>
<pre><table style="border:2px solid green"><tr><td>
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 1:
        continue
    print(num)

</table></tr></td></pre>
<h4><u>Output</u></h4>
<pre><table style="border:2px solid green"><tr><td>
2
4
</table></tr></td></pre>

In this example, the for loop iterates over the list numbers, and the code inside the loop, print(num), is executed only when the if statement 
evaluates to false, num % 2 == 0, the continue statement is encountered the current iteration is skipped and the program continues with the next iteration.


<h4><u>Pass Statement</u></h4>
<p>The pass statement in Python is used as a placeholder for a code block that has not been implemented yet or when a statement is 
required syntactically but you don't want any command or code to execute. It is used to prevent an error being thrown by the interpreter when 
a code block is empty.</p>
</ul>
<h4><u>Syntax:</u></h4>
<pre><table style="border:2px solid green"><tr><td>
if x > 0:
    pass
</pre>
</table><table style="border:2px solid green"><tr><td><a href="../content.html">Back</a></td></tr></table>
