<h2><u>1. Python ─ Overview:</u></h2>

<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python
is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other
languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</p>



<ul>
<li>	<b>Python is Interpreted:</b> Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not
	need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.
</li>

<li> 	<b>Python is Interactive:</b> You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the
	interpreter directly to write your programs.
</li>
	<b>Python is Object-Oriented:</b> Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of
	programming that encapsulates code within objects.
</li>

<li> 	<b>Python is a Beginner's Language:</b> Python is a great language for the beginner-level
	programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from
	simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="text-align:center"><u>History Of Python</u></h1>

<p>
History of Python
Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the
National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.
Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68,
SmallTalk, Unix shell, and other scripting languages.
Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the GNU General
Public License (GPL).
Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although Guido van
Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.

<h3>Python Features</h3>
<ul>
<li> 	<b>Fast and Efficient:	</b> 	Easy-to-learn: Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax.
	 				This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.
</li>
<li>	<b>Easy-to-read:	</b>    Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.
</li>
<li><b>Easy-to-maintain: </b> 	        Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.
					 A broad standard library: Python's bulk of the library is very portable and crossplatform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.</li>
<li><b>Interactive Mode:</b> :		 Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.
</li>
<li><b>Portable:</b> 			Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.
</li>

<li><b>Extendable:</b> 			You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.
</LI>
<li><b> Databases:</b>  		Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.
</LI>
<li><b> GUI Programming:</b>  		Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries, and windows systems, such as Windows MFC,
</LI>					Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.
<li><b> Scalable:</b>  		Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.
</LI>
</ul>



<h2><u>2. Install Python</u></h2>
			<p>Python distribution is available for a wide variety of platforms. You need to download only the binary code applicable for your platform and install Python.
2. Python ─ Environment
If the binary code for your platform is not available, you need a C compiler to compile the
source code manually. Compiling the source code offers more flexibility in terms of choice of
features that you require in your installation.
Here is a quick overview of installing Python on various platforms:</p>





<p><b>Unix and Linux Installation
</b>(We Recommend this) <u>Download Link:</u> <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"></a>
<li>		 Follow the link to download zipped source code available for Unix/Linux.
<li>		 Download and extract files.
<li>		 Editing the Modules/Setup file if you want to customize some options.
<li>		 run ./configure script
<li>		 make
<li>		 make install
<li>		This installs Python at standard location /usr/local/bin and its libraries at
		<i>/usr/local/lib/pythonXX where XX is the version of Python.</i>
</p>

<p><b>Windows Installation<a href="https://www.python.org"></a></b>

<li>		 Follow the link for the Windows installer python-XYZ.msi file where XYZ is the version you need to install.</li>
<li>		To use this installer python-XYZ.msi, the Windows system must support Microsoft
		Installer 2.0. Save the installer file to your local machine and then run it to find out if
		your machine supports MSI.</li>

<li>		Run the downloaded file. This brings up the Python install wizard, which is really easy to use.Just accept the default settings, wait until the install is finished, and you are
done.</li>
</p>
<h2>Running Python</h2>
<p>There are three different ways to start Python:
<b>Interactive Interpreter:</b> Start coding right away in the interactive interpreter. 
You can start Python from Unix, DOS, or any other system that provides you a command-line interpreter or shell window.Enter python the command line.
</p>

</pre>
<h5><u>Start coding right away in the interactive interpreter. </u></h5>
<pre>
<table style="border:4px solid green">	<tr><td>
	$python # Unix/Linux
	or
	python% # Unix/Linux
	or
	C:>python # Windows/DOS
	</td></tr></table>
</pre>



</pre>
<h4>Script from the Command-line </h4>
A Python script can be executed at command line by invoking the interpreter on your
application, as in the following:
<pre>
<table style="border:2px solid black"> <tr> <td>
	$python script.py	# Unix/Linuxor
	python% script.py 	# Unix/Linuxor 
	C:>python script.py	# Windows/DOS
	

</table></tr></td>
</pre>

<h2> Integrated Development Environment</h2>
<p>You can run Python from a Graphical User Interface (GUI) environment as well, if you have a
GUI application on your system that supports Python.
<li><b> Unix:</b> IDLE is the very first Unix IDE for Python.</li>
<li><b> Windows:</b> PythonWin is the first Windows interface for Python and is an IDE with a
GUI.</li>
</p>




<h2><u>Hello World Program</u></h4>
<p>Let's write Python program to print <b>Hellow World</b>.</p>
<h4>PROGRAM CODE</h4>
<pre><p style="background-color:white">#Program to print a Hello world
print("Hello World!!!")
<table style="border:2px solid black"><tr><td>
<b>Output</b>
	Hello World!!!
</table></tr></td>
</p></pre>

<h4>Basic Model of Computation</h4>
<li><b>Problem definition:</b> A problem definition involves the clear identification of the problem in terms of available input parameters and desired solution.</li>
<li><b>Approach towards solving the problem:</b> After a problem is identified, the user needs to implement a step-by-step solution in terms of algorithms.</li>
<li><b>Graphical representation of problem solving sequence:</b> This step involves representing the steps of algorithm pictorially by using a flowchart.Each component of the flowchart presents a definite process to solve the problem. </li>
<li><b>Converting the sequence in a programming language:</b> Converting the graphical sequence of processes into a language that the user and the computer can understand and use for problem solving is called programming.
After the program is compiled the user can obtain the desired solution for the problem by executing the machine language version of the program.</li>

<h3>Algorithm</h3>
<p>A sequential solution of any program that written in human language, called algorithm. Algorithm is first step of the solution process, after the analysis of problem, programmer writes
 the algorithm of that problem. It can be understood by taking an example of cooking a new recipe. To cook a new recipe, one reads the instructions and steps and
 execute them one by one, in the given sequence. The result thus obtained is the new dish cooked perfectly. Similarly, algorithms help to do a task in programming
 to get the expected output. The Algorithm designed are language-independent, i.e. they are just plain instructions that can be implemented in any language, and yet
 the output will be the same, as expected.

<p><b>Characteristics of Algorithm:</b></p>
<li><b>  Clear and Unambiguous:</b> Algorithm should be clear and unambiguous. Each of its steps should be clear in all aspects and must lead to only one meaning.</li>
 <li><b>  Well-Defined Inputs:</b>  If an algorithm says to take inputs, it should be well-defined inputs.</li>
<li><b>   Well-Defined Outputs:</b>  The algorithm must clearly define what output will be yielded and it should be well-defined as well.</li>
<li><b>   Finite-ness:</b>  The algorithm must be finite, i.e. it should not end up in an infinite loops or similar.</li>
<li><b>   Feasible:</b>  The algorithm must be simple, generic and practical, such that it can be executed upon with the available resources. It must not contain some future technology, or anything.
<li><b>   Language Independent:</b> The Algorithm designed must be language-independent, i.e. it must be just plain instructions that can be implemented in any language, and yet the output will be same, as expected.</li>
</p>



<p><b>Advantages of Algorithms:</b></p>
<li> It is easy to understand.
<li> Algorithm is a step-wise representation of a solution to a given problem.
<li> In Algorithm the problem is broken down into smaller pieces or steps hence, it is easier for the programmer to convert it into an actual program.

<p><b>Disadvantages of Algorithms::</b></p>
<li> Writing an algorithm takes a long time so it is time-consuming.
<li> Branching and looping statements are difficult to show in Algorithms.
</li>


<p><b>Example of Algorithm?</b></p>
Algorithm for add two numbers entered by the user. 
<li> Step 1: Start </li>
<li> Step 2: Declare 3 variables num1, num2 and sum. </li>
<li> Step 3: Read values num1 and num2. </li>
<li> Step 4: Add num1 and num2 and assign the result to sum. sum ← num1+num2 </li>
<li> Step 5: Print sum </li>
<li> Step 6: Stop
</li>
