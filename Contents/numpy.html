<h2><u>Numpy Introduction</u> </h2>
<p>NumPy (short for Numerical Python) is a powerful library for performing mathematical operations on arrays of data. 
It provides a wide range of functionality, including:
<li><b>Multidimensional arrays (ndarrays):</b> NumPy provides a powerful data structure called an ndarray, which is similar to a Python list but with the 
ability to perform mathematical operations on entire arrays of data at once.<l/i>
<li><b>Mathematical operations:</b> NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and matrix operations, 
that can be performed on ndarrays.<l/i>
<li><b>Linear algebra:</b> NumPy has a range of linear algebra functions, including matrix inversion, determinants, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.<l/i>
<li><b>Fourier Transform:</b> NumPy provides the functionality to do the Fourier transform and its inverse, on both one and multiple dimensional arrays.<l/i>
<li><b>Statistical functions:</b> NumPy provides a wide range of statistical functions, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and correlation coefficients.<l/i>
<li><b>Broadcasting:</b> In NumPy, broadcasting is a powerful mechanism that allows mathematical operations to be performed on arrays of different shapes.<l/i>
<li><b>Indexing and slicing:</b> NumPy provides a wide range of indexing and slicing options, including Boolean indexing and advanced indexing.<l/i>
<li><b>Input/Output:</b> NumPy provides functions to read and write arrays to and from files in various formats, such as CSV, Excel, and binary files.<l/i>
<li><b>Interoperability:</b> NumPy can be easily integrated with other libraries, such as SciPy, Matplotlib, and pandas, which provide additional functionality 
for data analysis and visualization.</li>
<p>In order to use NumPy, you need to first import it by using the following line of code:
</p>
<pre><table style="border:2px solid black"><tr><td>
import numpy as np
</td></tr></table></pre>
With this, you can use all the functionalities of NumPy and you can create ndarray by passing list or tuple to the numpy array function like:
<pre><table style="border:2px solid black"><tr><td>
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
</td></tr></table></pre>
You can also specify the data type while creating the numpy array:
<pre><table style="border:2px solid black"><tr><td>
a = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=float)
</td></tr></table></pre>
You can perform mathematical operations on ndarray, for example:
<pre><table style="border:2px solid black"><tr><td>
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
c = a + b
</td></tr></table></pre>
You can also perform matrix operations, for example:
<pre><table style="border:2px solid black"><tr><td>
a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
c = np.matmul(a, b)
</td></tr></table></pre>
<p>This is a brief overview of what NumPy is and some of its features. There is much more to learn about NumPy and its capabilities, but I hope this gives 
you an idea of what it can do.</p>
<h2><u>Arrays</h2></u>
In addition to 1D and 2D arrays, NumPy also supports arrays with more dimensions, such as <b>0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays.</b>
0D arrays, also known as scalars, are arrays with zero dimensions. They are similar to a single value and can be created by passing a single value to the NumPy array() function. For example:

<pre><table style="border:2px solid black"><tr><td>
import numpy as np
a = np.array(5)
print(a)
This will create a 0D NumPy array a with the value 5.
</td></tr></table></pre>
<b>1D arrays,</b> also known as vectors, are arrays with one dimension. They are similar to a list of numbers and can be created by passing a list or tuple of numbers to the NumPy array() function. For example:
<pre><table style="border:2px solid black"><tr><td>
import numpy as np
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(a)
This will create a 1D NumPy array a with the values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
</td></tr></table></pre>
<b>2D arrays,</b> also known as matrices, are arrays with two dimensions. They can be thought of as a table of numbers, where each row and column represents a different dimension. They can be created by passing a nested list or tuple of numbers to the NumPy array() function. For example:
<pre><table style="border:2px solid black"><tr><td>
import numpy as np
b = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
print(b)
This will create a 2D NumPy array b with the values [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]].
</td></tr></table></pre>
<b>3D arrays,</b> also known as tensors, are arrays with three dimensions. They can be thought of as a stack of matrices, where each matrix represents a different dimension. They can be created by passing a nested list or tuple of numbers to the NumPy array() function. For example:
<pre><table style="border:2px solid black"><tr><td>
import numpy as np
c = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]])
print(c)
This will create a 3D NumPy array c with the values [[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]].
</td></tr></table></pre>
You can also use other numpy functions like np.zeros((2,3,4)) or np.ones((3,4,5)) to create 3D arrays with all elements as 0 or 1 respectively.

You can access the elements of the array by indexing, You can use the indexing notation like you do with list, for example to access the element at 2nd depth, 
2nd row and 3rd column of 3D array c you can use c[1,1,2].
<h3><u>Numpy Data Types</h3></u>
<li>np.bool_: Boolean (True or False) type</li>
<li>np.int_: Platform-dependent integer type</li>
<li>np.float_: Platform-dependent float type</li>
<li>np.complex_: Platform-dependent complex type</li>
<li>np.object_: Platform-dependent Python object type</li>
<li>np.string_: Platform-dependent string type</li>
<li>np.unicode_: Platform-dependent Unicode string type</li>
<p>NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python that provides a wide range of functions for working with arrays and matrices.</br> 
Some of the most commonly used functions in NumPy include:</p>
<li>np.array(): Creates an array from a given list or tuple</li>
<li>np.zeros(): Creates an array of zeros with a specified shape</li>
<li>np.ones(): Creates an array of ones with a specified shape</li>
<li>np.eye(): Creates an identity matrix with a specified size</li>
<li>np.linspace(): Creates an array of evenly spaced values within a specified range</li>
<li>np.arange(): Creates an array of evenly spaced values within a specified range, similar to the built-in range() function</li>
<li>np.random.rand(): Creates an array of random values between 0 and 1</li>
<li>np.random.randn(): Creates an array of random values sampled from a standard normal distribution</li>
<li>np.shape(): Returns the shape of an array</li>
<li>np.reshape(): Reshapes an array to a specified shape</li>
<li>np.transpose(): Returns the transpose of an array</li>

<p>A NumPy array is a multi-dimensional container of items of the same type and size. The shape of an array is a tuple of integers that specifies the number of 
elements along each dimension of the array.</p>
Here is an example of how to create a NumPy array and examine its shape:
<pre><table style="border:2px solid black"><tr><td>
  import numpy as np
# Create a 2x3 array of random integers between 0 and 9
  arr = np.random.randint(0, 10, (2, 3))
# Print the array
  print(arr)
# Output: [[8 4 5]
           [2 1 3]]

# Get the shape of the array
shape = np.shape(arr)
# Print the shape
print(shape)
# Output: (2, 3)
</td></tr></table></pre>
<p>
In this example, the array arr is a 2x3 array, meaning it has 2 rows and 3 columns. The np.random.randint() function is used to create an array of random integers 
between 0 and 9. The shape of the array is obtained using the np.shape() function and is a tuple of 2 integers (2, 3), representing the number of rows and columns 
in the array.
You can also use the ndarray.shape property to access the shape of an array, like this:
</p>
<pre><table style="border:2px solid black"><tr><td>
shape = arr.shape
print(shape)
</td></tr></table></pre>
You can use arr.shape[0] and arr.shape[1] to get the number of rows and columns respectively.
You can also reshape the array using numpy.reshape() function as follows:
<pre><table style="border:2px solid black"><tr><td>
new_shape = (3, 2)
arr = np.reshape(arr, new_shape)
this will reshape the array to 3 rows and 2 columns.
</td></tr></table></pre>
