<h2><u>Exception Handling</u> </h2>
<p>Exception handling is a process in which a program can respond to an exceptional circumstance, such as an error condition, in a controlled and predictable way. 
In Python, exceptions are events that are triggered when a program encounters an error or exceptional condition. When an exception occurs, the normal flow of 
the program is interrupted, and the program jumps to a special block of code designed to handle the exception. This block of code is known as an exception handler.
</p>
<b>The basic syntax for exception handling in Python is as follows:</b>
<pre><table style="border:2px solid green"><tr><td>
try:
    # code that may raise an exception
except ExceptionType:
    # code to handle the exception
</td></tr></table></pre>
<p>Here, the try block contains the code that may raise an exception, and the except block contains the code that will handle the exception if it occurs. 
The ExceptionType is the type of exception that the handler is designed to catch.
</p>
<pre><table style="border:2px solid green"><tr><td>
Example
try:
    x = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
</td></tr></table></pre>
<p>In this example, the try block contains a division operation that raises a ZeroDivisionError exception. The except block contains a message that is 
printed when the exception occurs.You can also use finally block to include some code that should be executed regardless of whether or not an exception occurs.
</p>
<pre><table style="border:2px solid green"><tr><td>
try:
    x = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
finally:
    print("This block will execute regardless of the exception")

</td></tr></table></pre>
<p>If you have multiple exception handling blocks in your code, you need to place the specific exception handling block first and then the more general one.
Also, you can use raise statement to throw an exception in the code.
</p>
<pre><table style="border:2px solid green"><tr><td>
if x < 0:
    raise ValueError("x should be positive")
</td></tr></table></pre>
This raises a ValueError exception with the message "x should be positive" if the value of x is less than zero.

<h2><u>File Handling</u> </h2>
<p>File handling in Python allows you to read from and write to files on your computer.
To read from a file, you can use the open() function to open the file, and then use the .read() method to read the contents of the file. 
Here's an example of how you might read the contents of a file named "example.txt":
</p>
<pre><table style="border:2px solid green"><tr><td>
Example:
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    contents = file.read()
    print(contents)
</td></tr></table></pre>
<p>
The first argument passed to the open() function is the file name, and the second argument is the mode in which the file should be opened. 
In this case, "r" stands for read mode.
To write to a file, you can use the open() function to open the file in write mode ("w"), and then use the .write() method to write data to the file. 
Here's an example of how you might write the string "Hello, world!" to a file named "example.txt":
</p>
<pre><table style="border:2px solid green"><tr><td>
Example:
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, world!")
</td></tr></table></pre>
It's also worth noting that you can also use the a mode to open a file for appending, which allows you to add data to the end of an existing file, without overwriting its content.
<pre><table style="border:2px solid green"><tr><td>
with open("example.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("\nappended line")
</td></tr></table></pre>

It is important to close the file after your operation is finished, otherwise the file will remain locked and you will not be able to access it. T
he with statement is useful in this case, it automatically takes care of closing the file after the indented block of code is executed.

You can also use .readlines() method to read the content of the file line by line, or .readline() method to read one line at a time.
<pre><table style="border:2px solid green"><tr><td>
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line)
</td></tr></table></pre>
These are the basic method for file handling in python, but there are many other ways to manipulate files and folders like os, shutil etc.
<p>
In Python, a file can be opened in one of several modes, which determine the operations that can be performed on the file. The following are the most commonly used file modes in Python:
</p>
<pre><table style="border:2px solid red"><tr><td>
<ul><li><b>'r'</b>: This is the default mode and stands for "read." It is used to read the contents of an existing file.</br></ul></li>
<ul><li><b>'w'</b>: This stands for "write." It is used to create a new file or overwrite an existing file.</br></ul></li>
<ul><li><b>'a'</b>: This stands for "append." It is used to add new data to the end of an existing file.</br></ul></li>
<ul><li><b>'x'</b>: This stands for "create exclusive." It is used to create a new file, but it fails if a file with the same name already exists.</br></ul></li>
<ul><li><b>'b'</b>: This stands for "binary." It is used to open a file in binary mode. It can be used in conjunction with the other modes, 
for example, 'rb' for reading a binary file, 'wb' for writing a binary file.</br></ul></li>
<ul><li><b>'t'</b>: This stands for "text." It is used to open a file in text mode. It is the default mode, so it doesn't need to be specified if you're opening 
a text file.</br></ul></li>
</td></tr></table></pre>
<pre><table style="border:2px solid blue"><tr><td>
Example:
# Open a file in read mode
f = open("example.txt", "r")

# Open a file in write mode
f = open("example.txt", "w")

# Open a file in append mode
f = open("example.txt", "a")

# Open a file in create exclusive mode
f = open("example.txt", "x")

# Open a file in binary mode
f = open("example.bin", "rb")

# Open a file in text mode
f = open("example.txt", "t")
</td></tr></table></pre>
